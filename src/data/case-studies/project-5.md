        <p>Feefo’s digital products had grown over time, but without a unified design system, inconsistencies in design, slower development times, and fragmented collaboration became significant challenges. To address these issues, I led the redesign of their design system, focusing on improving component consistency, creating a robust set of design tokens, and collaborating closely with engineering to implement a scalable component library in Storybook.</p>

  heading: "Challenge"
  content: "
      <p>Feefo’s existing design system was outdated, lacked scalability, and led to inefficiencies in both design and development. Key challenges included:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Inconsistent component designs across platforms.</li>
          <li>Lack of a structured naming convention for design tokens.</li>
          <li>Slow handoff process between design and engineering teams.</li>
          <li>Redundant development efforts due to missing or poorly documented components.</li>
      </ul>

  heading: "Solution"
  content: "
      <p>The solution involved a comprehensive overhaul of the existing design system with a focus on scalability, consistency, and usability for both designers and developers:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Component Redesign:</strong> Audited and redesigned over 50 UI components with a focus on usability, accessibility, and visual consistency.</li>
          <li><strong>Design Tokens:</strong> Established a robust set of design tokens to manage colours, typography, spacing, and elevations for easy theme management.</li>
          <li><strong>Storybook Integration:</strong> Worked closely with engineering to build a comprehensive component library in Storybook, ensuring accurate implementation and documentation.</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Created thorough documentation for designers and developers, hosted in Figma and utilising the Dev Mode functionality, to ensure ease of use and adoption.</li>
      </ul>

  heading: "Process"
  content: "
      <p>The redesign process was highly collaborative, iterative, and user-focused:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Conducted stakeholder interviews and audited the existing design assets to identify key areas for improvement.</li>
          <li><strong>Design Exploration:</strong> Created new component designs in Figma with semantic naming conventions and responsive variants.</li>
          <li><strong>Token Creation:</strong> Developed a scalable token system in Figma, mirrored in the codebase for consistency.</li>
          <li><strong>Engineering Collaboration:</strong> Held weekly syncs with engineers to ensure alignment, validate designs, and review Storybook components.</li>
          <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Ran usability testing sessions with internal teams to ensure the components were intuitive and easy to implement.</li>
      </ul>
