  content: "Checkatrade partnered with Heatable to embed their instant quote and booking tool into the Checkatrade user journey. The goal was to provide a seamless experience where users could begin on the Checkatrade platform and smoothly transition to Heatable’s interface with full confidence and trust.<br /><br />As the lead Product Designer, I designed the end-to-end process, focusing on cross-brand consistency and user trust. I conducted user testing to validate the journey, ensuring that users understood they were still supported by Checkatrade while interacting with Heatable’s tool."
