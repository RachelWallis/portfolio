> TLDR; A design system helps developers, designers, and stakeholders speak the same language, fostering alignment and efficient collaboration.

In today’s fast-paced digital world, collaboration between developers, designers, and other stakeholders is essential to creating cohesive, high-quality products. One tool that ensures this collaboration happens smoothly is the design system. But what exactly is a design system, and how can it help everyone stay aligned while working efficiently?

## Design Systems: Building Software Better and Faster

When creating websites or software, we rely on teams of extraordinarily talented people. As technology continues to advance, the remit and challenges of these teams grow, producing bigger and better results.

Ensuring that the end-to-end process remains powerful and efficient has never been more crucial to maintaining speed and accuracy in our delivery. One of the most effective ways to ‘join the dots’ between teams is through the implementation of design systems.

But how exactly do they benefit us? Who owns them? And how do they avoid creating friction?

Do the designers tell the developers what to do? Do the developers dictate what the limitations are? Do the marketing team jump in and declare what color buttons must be? Spoiler: Nope, we’re all in it together!

## What Is a Design System?

In the simplest terms, a design system is a ‘language’ that everyone can speak to discuss what the User Interface (UI) of an application or website looks and behaves like.

Think of it as building a ‘lego house’ with a friend.

## The Lego House Analogy

George (the designer) might start designing the house; they sketch a pink house with a white picket fence and a cat at the window. The house is small and cozy with an unusual black roof.

So they tell Jody (the builder) what they want; they have sketched it out and talk with their friend about the idea. Everyone is happy, and the builder starts building.

Long story short: the sketch is great, the lego house is great. But they don’t match.

In reality, the sketch isn’t detailed enough to properly explain which sized bricks are needed in each space; it didn’t mention the windows were transparent, and the builder couldn’t create cats with the tools provided (lego), so they used a flower instead.

## What Went Wrong?

Why didn’t the designer give more info?

Why didn’t the builder ask more questions?

Because everyone assumed they knew what was needed, they did what they thought best with the tools available, and they didn’t think to check or ask because they just got on with it.

The end result? It wasn’t bad, but not quite right….

## How Could We Improve?

If the designer knew exactly what tools were available, they could have used that in their design before they started drawing. If the developer knew there was going to be a cat in the requirements, they could have discussed how necessary it was to the end goal and found out if there was any way to acquire a lego cat and how much it would cost.

Essentially, if everyone starts with the same information, the same goals, the same shade of red, the same sized lego bricks, we are starting with a plan in place to succeed that speeds up the process and gives us better results in the end.

## Who Is a Design System For?

If you work in any kind of team that creates digital products, a design system is for you. It’s a collaborative tool that benefits:

- **Designers**: Ensuring consistency and a unified design language.
- **Developers**: Providing clear guidelines and reusable components.
- **Product Managers**: Streamlining processes and reducing misunderstandings.
- **Marketing Teams**: Maintaining brand consistency across all channels.

By implementing a design system, teams can work more efficiently, reduce redundancy, and create products that provide a seamless user experience.
