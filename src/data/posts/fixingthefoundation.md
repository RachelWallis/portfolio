> **TLDR;** Assessing your digital product's foundation is crucial for long-term success. Learn how to evaluate and align your platform with business objectives.

If you’re considering pausing development to set your digital product up for long-term success, the first step is a thorough assessment of your current platform. This process isn't just about identifying faults—it's about understanding your current position to map out a path forward.

## Aligning Your Digital Product with Business Objectives

Your digital product should align with your broader business goals. To assess if your platform meets these objectives, consider the following questions:

### What Are the Key Metrics?

- **Identify OKRs and Business Metrics:** Determine the Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) or business metrics driving your product's evolution. Are these metrics influencing your team's next steps? Are they realistic given your platform's current state?

### What Are the Revenue and Growth Targets?

- **Evaluate Performance:** If revenue growth has stagnated or development cycles are slow, it may indicate that your product’s foundation is hindering your ability to respond swiftly to market demands.

### What Are the Constraints and Limitations?

- **Assess Resources:** Consider current constraints—budget, time, team capacity—that might affect your ability to implement changes. Being realistic about what's possible is crucial for effective planning.

### Do You Have Strategic Planning Commitments?

- **Long-Term Plans:** Identify any long-term plans that could be impacted by a digital transformation. Determine if the potential for short-term growth outweighs your long-term strategy. Pursuing both simultaneously can be challenging; continuous development of temporary solutions that require redoing is costly.

Aligning your digital product's growth with business objectives ensures that your transformation efforts deliver tangible value.
