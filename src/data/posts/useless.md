      There is a good chance your website is failing you — yes, really*.
        <br /><br />
      There is a good chance it’s not doing what you think it should. Sure, it might look good, be responsive, and even have the right content. But without a clear purpose, your website is little more than a pretty picture, or maybe a potted plant, something nice to look at but not much more than that.

        Here’s the hard truth: a website without a specific goal is useless. And chances are, if you haven’t taken the time to define the purpose of your website and align it with your business objectives, it’s already falling short.
        <br /><br />

        This article will guide you through the process of evaluating your website’s purpose and help you turn it into the powerful tool it was meant to be.
        <br /><br />

        <strong>Why Many Websites Fail</strong>       <br />
        There are millions of websites out there, yet so many of them don’t serve a clear purpose. They exist because someone told you a website is essential for business (and they’re right, it is), but beyond that, no real thought was given to what the website should actually do.
            <br /><br />
        Websites aren’t magic: A website isn’t a one-size-fits-all tool that will magically generate leads or close sales just because it’s online.
                    <br /><br />

        <strong>So, why does your website exist?</strong>       <br />
        Is it just because you were told you needed one? Because everyone has one. Or do you have a clear need, with measurable goals in place for what you want your website to achieve?
            <br /><br />

        Here’s where many business owners, designers, and developers get stuck.
            <br /><br />
        They think of their website as a digital platform where they can dump all their content, services, and products, hoping it will somehow magically work. But for a website to be useful, you need to define its purpose. Without a clear, focused goal, your site is nothing more than a glorified virtual business card.
